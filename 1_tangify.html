<b>Brief</b><br>
About 10% of the world population is living with some form of disability. Teaching cognitively impaired children requires a lot of repetition from the teacher’s end. Teaching only the numbers 1 & 2 can take as long as 2 months. We decided to make an intervention as an attempt to reduce the teacher’s effort and to improve the learning curve of the children. 
Tangify is a multimodal interactive toolkit developed for specially abled children in the age group of 3 to 7 years to teach them about everyday objects. 
(Video)
<br>
<br>
<b>The Target User Group</b><br>
Primary Persona: Specially abled children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), Cerebral Palsy, Down’s Syndrome and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
<br>
<br>
<b>The Research Phase</b><br>
The solution was developed through a user centred design approach. 
The project started with field a visit to Shishi Sarothi, a rehabilitation & training centre for specially abled persons located in Guwahati.  Later on, we decided to focus on their ‘playgroup’ which carried out activities conducted in pre-schools or in the playgroup wing of a regular school but the special needs are always given the maximum importance. A literature review was conducted by to develop a better understanding of the target users and have a look at the existing interventions. 
On the second visit, a contextual inquiry was conducted wherein we as Silent Observers, observed the environment and how the children were interacting among selves and with the teachers. With permission, we clicked photographs of the environment.  We participated with the children in various activities in the classroom and assisted the teachers. We interviewed 5 stakeholders including 3 teachers, the psychologist and the executive director of the organization to understand how they work and the type of problems they were facing. The interviews were open ended and guided by a questionnaire.  Also, conducted an artifact analysis and looked at the toys, flash cards and apparatus being used.
We observed that the teacher’s taught the children about everyday objects through like vegetables using artificial vegetables or flash cards. The teacher presented the student the artificial object or flash card, repeatedly recited the object’s name. The extensive repetition by the teacher, done on a one to one basis with the children requires a lot of effort. The class had 18 students and 3 teachers which could attend only 1 student at a time. We decided to make an intervention that would improve the learning curve while reducing the teacher’s effort.
<br>
<br>
<b>Goals</b><br>
-   Teach the students about everyday objects<br>
-   Reduce the number of repetitions the teachers have to make while teaching students.<br>
-   Engaging for the children<br>
-   Develop the motor skills of children and improve eye-hand co ordination
<br>
<br>
<b>The Solution </b> <br>
Tangify composes of: <br>
Tangify Platform: An electronic board with 4 rectangular slots <br>
Tangify Tokens: Hollow cuboids on which various fruits and vegetables may be attached <br>
A computer: For giving audio and visual cues. <br>
When the tokens are placed in slots of the platform, the computer gives audio and visual cues relevant to the token based upon the slot it was placed in. We decided to teach the children about fruits using artificial fruit as tokens.
(GIF infographic of how it works> learning module , Quiz module)
<br>
<br>
<i>Learning Module</i><br>
The platform has four slots corresponding to the name of the fruit, the colour, the spelling and how it is drawn. The children picked a fruit and placed it in one of the 4 slots. Corresponding to the action, an animated video was played back a few times. If a ‘banana’ was placed in the ‘colour’ slot, the system would recite, ‘banana is yellow’ accompanied with visuals and music. 
<br>
<br>
<i>Quizzing Module</i><br>
After the children have learned about the fruits, the system can ask questions like, ‘Which fruit is yellow?’ and the user would place a ‘banana’ in any of the slots.
The children get positive appraisals in form of visual and audio cues on the computer for the right answers. During our research, we identified that the teachers would draw a star on the student’s notebook if he performed well. 
If the student places the wrong fruit in the slot, they’re prompted and given another chance.

<br>
<br>
<b>Prototyping</b><br>
A high- fidelity prototype was made using a Makey-Makey micro controller connected to a laptop. Tangify Platform consists of a base with slots to represent four different properties. The platform is constrained to allow only one token to be placed on the platform on one of the slots. The token consists of a fruit glued to a hollow cuboid. Each token has a metal plate at its base, fitted in a particular orientation. Placing the token in a compartment completes a specific circuit of the Makey-Makey and sends the computer a message. The message is read by Processing, and a video on the particular characteristic of the fruit is played back.
For creating tokens we used artificial fruits to make recognition of fruits easier for the children. We learned during the research that artificial fruits are more effective while learning in comparison to printed flash cards. 
We rendered colourful animated videos with music as we found out during our research that the children are very fond of bright colours and animated videos.
<br>
<br>
<b>Evaluation</b><br>
We conducted the first round of user testing at Shishu Sarothi with 8 children belonging to the age group of 3-7. Tangify was put up in the classroom and children interacted with the system one by one. The children were given a first-hand demonstration and then allowed to interact with the system freely as per their own understanding and they were assisted by a teacher whenever required.
The results of the user testing were quite encouraging as most of the children were able to figure how the system is supposed to be used after the first hand demonstration. 
The children felt very joyful to see the animated videos with music on the screen whenever they placed a token on the Tangify platform. They were self-motivated to keep interacting with the system without much assistance from the teacher. Interestingly, some children were also reciting along with the video. In the next stage of the user testing, we would test the prototype over a duration of two months to see if there is a improvement in the learning curve of the children. <br>
Shortfall: While designing Tangify, we kept it colourful as that attracts children. However, according to an expert teacher, the usage of polka dots on the Tangify tokens with fruits was not a very good idea as it made it visually a little harder for the special children to perceive the fruit.

<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Tangify allows the children to engage with the system on their own without much assistance from the teachers. Though teachers intervention cannot be completely reduced due to the severity of the problem but our system aims at reducing the the effort of the teacher while making the learning process much more playful and engaging for children.
After the first phase of user testing the results were encouraging and we will continue to test it across for a reasonable amount of time and see if there is any improvement in the learning curve of students through Tangify. Currently the Tangify platform is used to teach only about fruits, however, if successful it can be expanded to other objects such as vegetables, stationary, number, shapes etc.

We are very grateful to Prof. Keyur Sorathia for his guidance and support with desired resources required during the course of this project. We would also like to thank Shishu Sarothi for allowing us to conduct a study at their premises.

         Tangify is Tangible Learning Toolkit that has been specially designed for specially abled children of age group of 3-7 years. The targeted solution mainly targets three disabilities including autism, cerebral palsy and ADHD. In the current system that we have designed, children can learn about different characteristics of a fruits by placing different tokens of the fruit in different compartments of the Tangify platform.
